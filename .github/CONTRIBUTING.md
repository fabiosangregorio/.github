# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). As a general guideline for both is: search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Issues
Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Report Bugs
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

#### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce
  * Be specific!
  * Give sample code if you can
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

# Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

* Only fix/add the functionality in question OR address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
* Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
* Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
* Include documentation in the repo or on our docs site.
* Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow:

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
1. Clone the project to your machine
1. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
1. Commit changes to the branch
1. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
1. Push changes to your fork
1. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

## Coding style
When making changes, please make sure to use the same coding style as the rest of the repository. Also check the README of the repository for an explicit enforced coding style standard.

## Getting help
Feel free to send me an email for any questions, concerns or doubts.

## License
When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same software license that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
